# 911 Calls Data Analysis Project

A comprehensive data analysis project that explores emergency 911 call data using Python, focusing on patterns, trends, and insights from emergency service requests.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes 911 call data from Kaggle to understand:
- Emergency call frequency and patterns
- Geographic distribution of calls
- Types of emergencies
- Temporal trends (daily, monthly, and yearly patterns)

## Technologies Used
